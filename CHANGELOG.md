# v1.0 changes
- Support for rectangular pixelizations (CAR pixelization with Clenshaw-Curtis separation).
- Support for spin-0 and spin-2 covariance matrices.
- Convenience functions to recover bandpower windows and the unbinned mode-coupling matrix.
- Arbitrary ell-weighting (e.g. can compute D_l = l*(l+1)*C_l/2pi).
- Simultaneous calculation of the MCM for all spin-0 and spin-2 combinations.
