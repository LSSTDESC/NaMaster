# NaMaster

NaMaster is a C library, Python module and standalone program to compute full-sky angular cross-power spectra of masked, spin-0 and spin-2 fields with an arbitrary number of known contaminants using a pseudo-Cl (aka MASTER) approach. The code also implements E/B-mode purification and is available in both full-sky and flat-sky modes.


## Installation
Unless you care a lot about optimizing the code, you should probably use the conda recipe for NaMaster currently hosted on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/namaster) (infinite kudos to [Mat Becker](https://github.com/beckermr) for this). This means simply running:
```
conda install -c conda-forge namaster
```
If that works for you and you don't care about optimizing the code too much, skip the rest of this section. If you don't have admin permissions, you can give virtual environments a try (or else follow the instructions below).

### 0- Dependencies
NaMaster has the following dependencies, which should be present in your system before you can install the code:
* [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). Version 2 required.
* [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/). Version 3 required. Install with `--enable-openmp` and potentially also `--enable-shared`.
* [libsharp](https://github.com/Libsharp/libsharp) (see instructions in [NERSC_installation.md](NERSC_installation.md) for more details on how to install libsharp).
* [cfitsio](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/). Any version >3 should work.
* [HEALPix](https://sourceforge.net/projects/healpix/). Any version >2 should work. You only need to install the C libraries (including the shared ones).

### 1- C library
First, install the C library `libnmt`. In UNIX, in the simplest case, this should be a matter of running
```
./configure
make
make install
```
where the last command should be preceded by `sudo` if you need (and can get) admin privileges. If you don't have admin privileges, you can change the first command to
```
./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
```
where `/path/to/install` is an absolute path to the directory where the C library and include files will be installed.

If you have installed the C library in a non-standard path, you may have to add
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` for your system to be able to find `libnmt`.

Note that the installation process will also generate an executable `namaster`, residing in `/path/to/install/bin` that can be used to compute power spectra. The use of this program is discouraged over using the C library or python module.

Once you have installed the C library, you can check that everything works by running
```
make check
```
If all the checks pass, you're good to go.

### 2- Python module
Installing the python module `pymaster` should be as simple as running
```
python setup.py install [--user]
```
or, even better, if you can use `pip`:
```
pip install . [--user]
```
where the optional `--user` flag can be used if you don't have admin privileges.

You can check that the python installation works by running the unit tests:
```
python -m unittest discover -v
```
Note that the `test` directory, containing all unit tests, also contains all the sample python scripts described in the documentation (see below).

If you installed `pymaster` via `pip`, you can uninstall everything by running
```
pip uninstall pymaster
```
