# NaMaster

NaMaster is a C library, Python module and standalone program to compute full-sky angular
cross-power spectra of masked, spin-0 and spin-2 fields with an arbitrary number of known
contaminants using a pseudo-CL (aka MASTER) approach.

See http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105302 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03577 for further details.
