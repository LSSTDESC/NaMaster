Welcome to pymaster's documentation!
====================================

pymaster is the python implementation of the NaMaster library. The main purpose of this library is to provide support to compute the angular power spectrum of fields defined on a limited region of the sphere using the so-called pseudo-CL formalism.

Below you can find links to pymaster's full documentation and 8 different example scripts showcasing its usage. Understanding the last script in particular will allow you to make the most efficient use of this module.

We recommend that users read NaMaster's :download:`scientific documentation <doc_scientific.pdf>` to have a good understanding of the methods implemented in it.
